# **Food Waste Management System**


The integration of an efficient and automated food waste management system aimed at reducing food wastage, promoting food donation, and improving resource distribution to those in need. This system utilizes advanced algorithms and real-time data processing to optimize the donation and request process for food items, ensuring a seamless experience for both donors and recipients.

## **About**
The **Food Waste Management System** is designed to create a streamlined and effective way of managing food donations and requests. By integrating a user-friendly interface and real-time geolocation services, this system allows users to donate surplus food and request food assistance from food banks or charity organizations. The project aims to reduce food wastage, promote sustainability, and improve food security by connecting donors and recipients efficiently. It uses optimization algorithms to ensure that food distribution is managed effectively, minimizing waste and maximizing impact.

## **Features**
- Real-time food tracking and donation system.
- Geolocation integration for easy food pickup and delivery.
- Optimized matching algorithm for donations and requests.
- User-friendly interface for donors and recipients.
- Automated notifications for updates on donation or request status.
- Scalable cloud-based deployment using AWS or Firebase.
- Secure authentication and role-based access management.
- Data analytics for tracking food waste trends and improvement areas.

## **Requirements**
- **Operating System**: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with development frameworks.
- **Development Environment**: Node.js and Express.js for backend development, React.js for frontend development.
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data storage and efficient querying.
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS or Firebase for scalable deployment and real-time database functionality.
- **Geolocation Services**: Google Maps API for location-based services such as tracking food donations and requests.
- **Design**: Material-UI for responsive and user-friendly frontend design.
- **Version Control**: Git for collaborative development and code management.
- **IDE**: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
- **Additional Dependencies**: React, Express, MySQL, Google Maps API, JWT for authentication, AWS/Firebase SDK.

## **System Architecture**
The system follows a client-server architecture with the frontend interacting with the backend through RESTful APIs. The backend handles business logic, food donation and request matching, and stores data in a MySQL database. Geolocation services are integrated to ensure effective food distribution. Cloud services like AWS or Firebase are used for hosting and real-time database management.

## **Results and Impact**
The **Food Waste Management System** helps reduce food wastage by facilitating efficient food donation and request processes. By integrating geolocation and real-time data, it ensures that food reaches those in need in a timely and efficient manner. The system's optimization algorithms reduce operational inefficiencies and streamline the entire process. Ultimately, this project contributes to sustainability, better resource distribution, and improved food security, fostering a positive social impact. It can be extended to larger scales, such as urban centers or global food banks, to address food insecurity on a wider scale.
